            Math rounds consist of individual rounds, team rounds, and
            tiebreakers. Computational devices, graph paper, and protractors are
            prohibited. Rulers and compasses are allowed.

          <p class="additional-content hidden">
            For all tests, no computational devices, including but not limited
            to calculators, electronic devices, or abaci, are allowed.
            Similarly, graph paper and protractors are prohibited, but rulers
            and compasses are permitted. These tests will be conducted over
            Zoom. Throughout the entire duration of the contest, you must have
            your video on. At the beginning of the contest, rename yourself to
            put your individual ID in front of your name. For the individual,
            team, and tiebreaker rounds, you will receive a PDF containing the
            problems at the start of your allotted time. A timer will be on the
            screen reminding you of how much time is left, and you must submit
            the answer form within 1 minute of the timer expiring. If you have
            any clarification questions about the problems, you can directly
            message the proctors over Zoom, and they will get back to you with
            an answer.

            regularly check in on the breakout rooms. For clarification
            questions, you may come to the main room to ask a proctor, and they
            will send a global message if the question can be answered. You will
            receive a PDF containing the problems at the start of your allotted
            time. The score for the team round will be the total number of
            points earned from each question.

            For the programming competition, you may compete in teams of up to
            four individuals. The programming competition will be held on
            https://codeforces.com. Each team should sign up with one account,
            which every member of the team should be able to access. You can use
            https://codeforces.com/register to register an account on
            Codeforces. Once you have registered an account on Codeforces, use
            that account to request to become a Participant in the following
            group: https://codeforces.com/group/Am7lqUxQS0. Remember that ONLY
            the account that you registered with will be admitted into the
            group. Before the start of the contest, a contest manager will admit
            you into the group, where you will then be able to take the contest.
            Any outside sources are prohibited during the contest, although code
            that has been saved on your computer beforehand is permitted. Teams
            will be ranked by the total number of points they get. Teams can get
            up to 100 points on each problem, with points given to subtasks
            based on the problem description. Ties will be broken by the time of
            the last submission that added points to the teamâ€™s overall score.
            Any clarification questions can be raised within the Codeforces
            contest.
