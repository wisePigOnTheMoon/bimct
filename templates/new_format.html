                      The Countdown Round consists of short, easy problems that

                      will then read the problem out loud. Participants are

                      In every round, two players will compete to answer the
                      question as quickly and accurately as possible; the first
                      person to answer correctly gains a point. A player must
                      say their answer within 3 seconds of buzzing; attempting
                      to stall by using filler words or restating the question
                      will automatically disqualify you from answering the
                      question. Players may not answer a question again after
                      answering incorrectly. No points are awarded if no person
                      answers the question correctly when the time runs out. In
                      all rounds except the final, the first person to receive 2
                      points moves on. In the final round, the first person to
                      receive 3 points will win the Countdown Round. The winner
                      in each division will earn an additional prize.
