                <p class="text-xl mb-10">Anyone who ties for a top 10 score in each division will participate in a Tiebreaker Round. The Tiebreaker test has 5 problems that will challenge even the strongest competitors; the problems range from mid-AIME difficulty to Olympiad difficulty. The Tiebreaker Round proceeds as follows: questions are shown one at a time, with the most challenging question shown first. The times for the questions are as follows: Question 1, <b>25 minutes</b>; Question 2, <b>15 minutes</b>; Question 3, <b>10 minutes</b>; Question 4, <b>5 minutes</b>; Question 5, <b>5 minutes</b>. The first contestant to solve the first question wins the Tiebreaker Round; other contestants who solve the first question will be ranked by speed. Any contestants who submit an incorrect answer move on to the second question; similarly, accuracy and speed determine the rankings. This process repeats until all ties are broken. In the final round, if more than two people answer incorrectly, the person to answer incorrectly first places higher. All participants in the tiebreaker round must stay for the whole round in order to not betray the final rankings. </p>

                <p class="text-xl mb-10">After tiebreakers, the top 8 scorers in each division will participate in the
                    Countdown Round. The Countdown Round consists of short, easy problems that last <b>45 seconds</b>
                    each. In every round, two players will compete to answer the question as quickly and accurately as
                    possible; the first person to answer correctly gains a point. Players may not answer a question
                    again after answering incorrectly. No points are awarded if no person answers the question correctly
                    when the time runs out. In all rounds except the final, the first person to receive 2 points moves
                    on. In the final round, the first person to receive 3 points will win the Countdown Round. </p>

        <div class="flex flex-col justify-start items-start max-w-3xl mx-10">
            <p>- Individual Scores will be determined solely by the number of questions correctly answered on the
                Individual Round. </p>
            <p>- Ties will be broken through the Tiebreaker Round as described before. The maximum Individual Score is

            <p>- The Team Score is determined by the number of questions correctly answered on the Team Round. Teams
                will be ranked based on the following formula: </p>
            <div style="padding-left: 2em;">
                <p> - (Sum of Individual Scores of all team members / Number of people on the team) * 6 + (10 * Team Round Score)
